# Solar-panel-simulator
Solar panel simulator for universiy assignment

wrote a secure program for one of my university assignments.
Program is flawed in terms of security, however I did demonstrate the use of design patterns, OOP and smart pointers
this program was marked at 62% which is equivalent of a 2:1
